# Project ChatterCart
## Introduction
Project ChatterCart is a one stop shop for people to come and create for themselves a chatbot to attach to their website. 

The prject aims to help business owners create their chatbots with just a context file and few simple clicks.

The bot can perform tasks such as helping answer basic questions from the context file, to remembering previous conversations, booking appointments and much more.




## Objective
This is my take on the business idea as I dwell into Generative AI and try to create a SaaS-ish solution.

The project aims on making chabots more accessible and user friendly, while trying to make the model SaaS like and maybe impress a few investors!! lol...would be fun lets see.



## Versioning and Version Control.
We will have three set of branches through out the repository.
The first will be the main branch, second would be the progress branch and finally v_X.x branch.

As we progress through various versions you will find the current work in progress version in the progress branch.

The main branch would be the last worked on version with most appropriate set of changes made to it.

Current version details - The current of the project is just an MVP for the idea.

Version 0.0 (v_0.0) - The first version of the project. An MVP to get started with the project.
